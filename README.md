# SPI Slave With Single Port Memory

![SPI Protocol](Images/SPI_Protocol.gif)

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of an SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) communication protocol. The project includes the design and code for an SPI Slave, a single-port synchronous RAM, and an SPI Wrapper that connects the RAM and SPI Slave.

## SPI Communication Protocol
SPI is a synchronous serial communication protocol used for short-distance communication, primarily in embedded systems. It enables a master device to communicate with one or more slave devices at high speeds using a minimal number of I/O pins. The protocol uses four main signals:
- **MOSI (Master Out Slave In)**: Carries data from the master to the slave.
- **MISO (Master In Slave Out)**: Carries data from the slave to the master.
- **SCLK (Serial Clock)**: Clock signal generated by the master to synchronize data transmission.
- **SS/CS (Slave Select/Chip Select)**: Used by the master to select which slave to communicate with.

## Project Components
1. **SPI_SLAVE.v**: Implements the SPI Slave interface.
   - **Ports**:

     | tx_data  | Input  | 8 bits| Input Data for SPI Slave|
     | rst_n    | Input  | 1 bit | Active low asynchronous reset |
     | clk      | Input  | 1 bit | Clock                   |
     | MISO     | Output | 1 bit | Data Output             |
     | rx_valid | Output | 1 bit | Control for Output Data |
     | rx_data  | Output | 10 bits| Output Data for SPI Slave |

2. **RAM.v**: Implements a single-port asynchronous RAM.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `MEM_DEPTH`: Memory depth, default is 256.
     - `ADDR_SIZE`: Address size, default is 8 bits.
   - **Ports**:

     | Name     | Type   | Size  | Description             |
     |----------|--------|-------|-------------------------|
     | din      | Input  | 10 bits| Data Input             |
     | clk      | Input  | 1 bit | Clock                   |
     | rst_n    | Input  | 1 bit | Active low asynchronous reset |
     | rx_valid | Input  | 1 bit | If HIGH: accept din[7:0] to save the write/read address internally or write a memory word depending on the most significant 2 bits din[9:8] |
     | dout     | Output | 8 bits| Data Output             |
     | tx_valid | Output | 1 bit | Whenever the command is memory read the tx_valid should be High |

3. **SPI_Wrapper.v**: Connects the SPI Slave and RAM modules.
   - Handles the communication and data transfer between the SPI Slave and RAM.

## SPI Communication States

### 1. Write Address
1. Master starts the write command by sending the write address value, `rx_data[9:8] = din[9:8] = 2'b00`.
2. `SS_n = 0` to signal the SPI Slave that the master will begin communication.
3. SPI Slave checks the first received bit on the `MOSI` port which is a control bit to determine the operation (write in this case). The SPI Slave then expects to receive 10 bits, with the first 2 bits being "00" and the next 8 bits being the write address.
4. Data is converted from serial (MOSI) to parallel after writing to the `rx_data[9:0]` bus.
5. `rx_valid` will be HIGH (for one clock cycle) to inform the RAM to expect data on the `din` bus.
6. `din` takes the value of `rx_data`.
7. RAM checks `din[9:8]` and finds they hold "00".
8. RAM stores `din[7:0]` in the internal write address bus.
9. `SS_n = 1` to end communication from the master side.

### 2. Write Data
1. Master continues the write command by sending the write data value, `rx_data[9:8] = din[9:8] = 2'b01`.
2. `SS_n = 0` to signal the SPI Slave that the master will begin communication.
3. SPI Slave checks the first received bit on the `MOSI` port which is a control bit to determine the operation (write in this case). The SPI Slave then expects to receive 10 more bits, with the first 2 bits being "01" and the next 8 bits being the write data.
4. Data is converted from serial (MOSI) to parallel after writing to the `rx_data[9:0]` bus.
5. `rx_valid` will be HIGH (for one clock cycle) to inform the RAM to expect data on the `din` bus.
6. `din` takes the value of `rx_data`.
7. RAM checks `din[9:8]` and finds they hold "01".
8. RAM stores `din[7:0]` in the RAM with the previously held write address.
9. `SS_n = 1` to end communication from the master side.

### 3. Read Address
1. Master starts the read command by sending the read address value, `rx_data[9:8] = din[9:8] = 2'b10`.
2. `SS_n = 0` to signal the SPI Slave that the master will begin communication.
3. SPI Slave checks the first received bit on the `MOSI` port which is a control bit to determine the operation (read in this case). The SPI Slave then expects to receive 10 bits, with the first 2 bits being "10" and the next 8 bits being the read address.
4. Data is converted from serial (MOSI) to parallel after writing to the `rx_data[9:0]` bus.
5. `rx_valid` will be HIGH (for one clock cycle) to inform the RAM to expect data on the `din` bus.
6. `din` takes the value of `rx_data`.
7. RAM checks `din[9:8]` and finds they hold "10".
8. RAM stores `din[7:0]` in the internal read address bus.
9. `SS_n = 1` to end communication from the master side.

### 4. Read Data
1. Master continues the read command by sending the read data command, `rx_data[9:8] = din[9:8] = 2'b11`.
2. `SS_n = 0` to signal the SPI Slave that the master will begin communication.
3. SPI Slave checks the first received bit on the `MOSI` port which is a control bit to determine the operation (read in this case). The SPI Slave then expects to receive 10 bits, with the first 2 bits being "11" and the next 8 bits being dummy data, which will be ignored as the master waits for data from the slave.
4. Data is converted from serial (MOSI) to parallel after writing to the `rx_data[9:0]` bus.
5. `din` takes the value of `rx_data`.
6. RAM reads `din[9:8]` and finds they hold "11".
7. RAM reads from the memory with the previously held read address.
8. RAM asserts `tx_valid` to inform the slave that data output is ready.
9. Slave reads `tx_data` and converts it to serial output data on the `MISO` port.
10. `tx_valid` will be HIGH for 9 clock cycles (1+8).
11. `SS_n = 1` to end communication from the master side after receiving data for 8 clock cycles.
